# riversurf.academy Frontend

[Tim](https://github.com/mhmFrost), a fromer student now turned Padawan, and me have created unintentionally something very unique: It's called `Waterflow Design`.

It's optimized for mobile horizontal usage and gives you the impression of being out on the open sea with waves. Deep diving - literally - below the surface for more details. Until you reach the bottom of the sea where bubbles live - not really - but in this design it does. It combines intuitive elements of the mobile world with intuitive elements from the real sea world - Arggggh, I'm a pirate.

The heart of this project is to provide you with a cosmos for riversurfing. Starting from which river waves exist, what equipment to use, over to learn more fine grained control over your surfboard.

I already "tech" (= people asking me for advice) freely at the river waves I'm at. If you like more, you're able to book me for some sessions.
