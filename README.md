# riversurf.academy AI

[Tim](https://github.com/mhmFrost), a fromer student now turned Padawan, and me have created unintentionally something very unique: It's called `Waterflow Design`.

It's optimized for mobile horizontal usage and gives you the impression of being out on the open sea with waves. Deep diving - literally - below the surface for more details. Until you reach the bottom of the sea where bubbles live - not really - but in this design it does. It combines intuitive elements of the mobile world with intuitive elements from the real sea world - Arggggh, I'm a pirate.

The heart of this project is to provide you with an interactive AI cosmos for riversurfing. Starting from which river waves exist, what equipment to use, over to learn more fine grained control over your surfboard via video feedback.
